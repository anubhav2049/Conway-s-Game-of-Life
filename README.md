Small personal coding project, simulating Conway's Game of Life. Uses Matplotlib to graph around 100 generations. Not much else to add here, but could become more interactive later on. Uses libraries matplotlib and numpy. 


EDIT: New version (most likely final) that uses pygame module instead of matplotlib. A more visually understandable version.
